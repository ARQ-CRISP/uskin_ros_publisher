0 - No arm movement or slip (or any other relevant event)
1 - Static slip. Robot arm NOT moving, object-gripper contact displacement. 
	Only if it can be detected visually (video)
	Between samples where you can see displacements over the active taxels
	If robotic arm starts moving meanwhile, tag 5 should be used instead
2 - Object Release:
	Samples when robotic gripper releases the object.
	Many experiences won't have this tag since there is not intentional release of the object   		(object slips away)
3 - Object grasp:
	Samples when robotis  gripper is grasping the object
	Starts at first contact, up until the end of the task, or when object is stably grasped (no 		taxel changes)
4 - Robotic arm movement. No object gripper slip.
5 - Robotic arm movement + Object (dynamic) slip:
	When we are able to detect it visually (or in some cases through changes on the tactile taxels)
	Up until arm stops moving, or the object is again firmly hold by the gripper.
6 - Other events:
	This could be: Losing contact with the object, only to regain it moments later; Other unpredicted object-gripper tactile events.
        We can consider removing this samples when fitting a model.

The experiment finishes the moement the object is released of slips away from the robotic gripper
